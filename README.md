**Introduction:** Heart Stroke Prediction Model

Cardiovascular diseases, including strokes, represent a significant global health concern and are a leading cause of mortality. In response to this challenge, I have developed a predictive model aimed at identifying individuals at risk of experiencing a stroke. This project leverages data analytics and machine learning techniques to create a robust and accurate tool for stroke prediction.

**Background:**
According to the **World Health Organization (WHO)**, strokes account for approximately **11% of total deaths** worldwide. Early detection and intervention are crucial for reducing the impact of strokes on individuals and healthcare systems. Our project addresses this by utilizing a dataset containing essential information about patients, including demographic details, health metrics, and lifestyle factors.

**Dataset Overview:**
The dataset comprises various attributes such as age, gender, hypertension status, heart disease history, marital status, work type, residence type, average glucose level, body mass index (BMI), smoking status, and the occurrence of strokes. Each row represents a patient, and the goal is to predict whether a patient is likely to experience a stroke.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
Before developing the predictive model, I have conducted thorough **exploratory data analysis** to understand the distribution of variables, identify patterns, and gain insights into the relationships between different features and the occurrence of strokes. Visualization techniques, including **histograms**, **box plots**, and **countplots**, were employed to enhance our understanding of the data.

**Data Preprocessing:**
To ensure the quality of our model, I addressed missing data in the BMI column by imputing the mean value. Categorical variables were encoded, and the dataset was prepared for machine learning algorithms. Additionally, **I observed an imbalance in the target variable (stroke)**, prompting the utilization of the **Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE)** to address this issue.

**Model Development:**
A **logistic regression** model was initially trained on the dataset. However, due to the **imbalanced nature** of the data, the model's performance was suboptimal, particularly in identifying individuals at risk of strokes. Subsequently, I applied **SMOTE** to oversample the minority class and retrained the **logistic regression model**, resulting in improved predictive capabilities.

**Model Evaluation:**
The performance of the model was evaluated using various **metrics**, including **precision, recall, and F1-score.** The **confusion matrix** provided a detailed breakdown of the model's predictions, highlighting its ability to correctly identify instances of strokes.

**Insights and Future Directions:**
My project not only contributes to the field of predictive healthcare but also underscores the importance of addressing class imbalance for accurate risk assessment. Future work could involve further **feature engineering**, the exploration of alternative models, and continuous refinement based on emerging data to enhance the model's effectiveness in stroke prediction.
